                        60% of the coffee beans in the world that are produced are Arabica variety,
                        These beans are grown at high altitudes and need to be in an area that has a steady rainfall and
                        plenty of shade.Arabica is both full of flavour and aroma.

                        excellent choice for a real boost and offer a more harsh flavour.
                        The beans also have a smooth texture, which makes them ideal to have with milk and sugar.
